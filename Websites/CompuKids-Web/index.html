<!-- Web Image Types -->
<!-- Files Used on the Web
The three main digital image types are: gif, jpg (or jpeg) and png.
The main difference between them is the resulting image. Each one has its place for use on websites, and jpeg images can also be used in print files as well, although they need to be print resolution.
Image Resolution
Image resolution is the detail an image holds. The term applies to raster digital images, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more image detail.
Image resolution can be measured in dpi or "dots per inch". Web images are typically 72 dpi, making them load quickly.
Gif
Gif images are great for creating very low resolution files for your website.
Gif images support transparency. Transparency allows you to place the gif over any color background or even photos, and you won’t see a border or background in the image. All you will see is the icon.
You typically use a gif for simple logos, icons, or symbols.
Using a gif for photos is not recommended, because gifs are limited to 256 colors. In some cases you can use even less. The less colors that are in your image, the smaller your file size will be.
Gif files also support a feature called interlacing, which preloads the graphic. It starts out blurry and becomes focused and crisp when it is finished downloading. This makes the transition for your viewer easier, and they don’t have to wait as long to see logos or icons on your site.
Gifs also support animation. Gifs don’t support the level of animation that Flash files do, but it still allows you to add movement or transitions to your site, without a lot of programming or coding. More advanced web designers and developers tend to use jQuery to create animated effects.
Gif files are also compressed, which gives them a small file size.
You mainly use a gif file format for logos and graphics with solid areas of colour. You wouldn’t use a photographic image, or a graphic with gradients.
Jpeg
Jpeg files can be relatively small in size, but they still look crisp and beautiful.
Jpegs support up to 16.7 million colours, which makes them the right choice for complex images and photographs. With the wide range of colours, you can have beautiful imagery without a bulky file size.
With new responsive techniques, you can also have flexible images without large loading times.
There are also progressive jpegs, which preload similar to interlaced gifs. They start out blurry, but come into focus as their information loads.
PNG
PNG files were developed to build upon the purpose of gifs. Designers need the ability to incorporate low-resolution images that load quickly but also look great, and support transparency. This is where PNG comes in.
PNG transparency is different from Gif transparency, because they can have different levels of transparency, whereas Gifs are either transparent or opaque.
PNG files are lossless, which means that they do not lose quality during editing. This is unlike jpegs, where they lose quality. PNG files tend to be larger than jpegs, because they contain more information, and are lossless.
PNG files do not support animation. For this purpose, a gif should be used. -->

<!-- Resizing an Image
You can set image width and height using the width and height attributes.
You can specify width and height of your image in pixels. -->

<!-- Double quotes: check that you've used double quotes to define the width and height. For example, width=120 is incorrect but width="120" is correct. -->
          <img src="images/boat.jpg" width="150"/>
          <img src="images/boat.jpg" height="100"/>
